# qemu_openthread_borderrouter
Kernel image and instructions to deploy a virtual borderrouter test environment.

## Kernel Build Instructions
In case you want it you can build your own kernel and tweak it to add support to more devices/functions. In the steps below I will be using the .config file from this repo, apart of versatile-pb configuration it contains the below modules built-in:
* IPv6.
* USB Serial Support (For the very popular FT232 transceivers, tweak this option in case you use some other) .

Adjust the below commands to the OS you are using. In this case I'm using Arch Linux with trizen as AUR package manager.
Install some dependencies:
```
sudo pacman -Syy
sudo trizen -S libcurses5-compat
sudo trizen -S arm-linux-
```


```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
```
